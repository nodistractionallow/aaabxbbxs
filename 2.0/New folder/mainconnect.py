#NEXT UPDATE -
#ADD NO-BALLS
#ADD BYES/LEGBYES
#SHOW NOT OUT IF CAME IN BUT DIDN'T BAT
#FIX BOWLING SELECTION
#If bowling rate is less than x then dont bowl
#IMPROVE BOWLER ROTATION
#If RRR is low in the last 10, team may falter, fix it
#designate 6 bowlers and bowl them in a shuffled
#see for localBattingOrder

#K Williamson bowling

#TRANSLATE RATING TO DEN AVG, OUT AVG, ETC.

#BIPUL SHARMA - OVERPOWERED AND SO ->
# - 1. MAKE SURE PLAYER HAS PLAYED X NUMBER OF GAMES OR ELSE DRIVE DOWN HIS RATINGS (such as avgs, dens, etc.) (!!!IMPORTANT)
# - 2. DO FOR BOTH BATTING & BOWLING SEPARATELY
#BAD PLAYERS GETTING GOOD SCORES DURING CHASE, SEE TO THAT (RELATED TO PREV ONE, REDUCE PLAYERS
# WHO HAVE PLAYED A FEW GAMES' 6s, 4s, RATE AND INCREASE OUT AVG AND 0s, 1s)
#CHECK IF PLAYER HAS PLAYED LESS THAN X NUMBER OF BALLS, OR BOWLED LESS THAN X NUMBER OF BALLS
#IF BAT RUNS 0, OR VERY LOW, CREATE FILLER WHICH IS VERY BAD FOR BATTING (highs 0s,1s, outavg, low 4s, 6s: see other
#tail-enders for reference)

#Triple not out
#not many 100s
#12-over rule
#too many dots (increase 1s & 2s, reduce 0s)
#too many all-outs

#Last 10 overs both innings very slow even when 1-2 wickets fall (too many wickets fall)
#weigh economy more, if eco is like 6 or 7, then bowl over a player with 1 wicket but 9 economy
#dont drag game too long if rrr < 9 in last 3-4 overs

#IMP
#12-17 over increase rate (1st innings) & (2nd innings too)
#Wickets (140s scores with 3 wickets in 1st innings - fix it (apply 2nd inn logic))

#FEATURES
#Commentary
#GUI
#Super overs
#Better rotation
#Venue
#Six distance
#Type of shot
#Match summaries
#i will ask different people for shot selection of players and then average them out while eliminating outliers
#Add option to add custom players by fabricating stats
